## Setting Up a Web Interface Using ComfyUI

To quickly set up a web interface using ComfyUI, follow these steps:

1.Locate the Custom Nodes Directory: Find the custom_nodes directory within ComfyUI.

2.Clone or Download the Repository: Clone or download the repository directly into custom_nodes.

3.Access Interface: Use your web browser to visit http://<comfy_address>:<comfy_port>/<project_name>, where <project_name> is the name of the cloned repository (ex: http://127.0.0.1:8188/comfygen).

4.Replace with Your Own Workflow: Follow these steps to replace the default workflow with your own:

- Enable Dev Mode Options in the ComfyUI interface by clicking on the Settings area.
  
- Return to the ComfyUI interface, and you will now see the "Save (API Format)" option.
  
- Click on "Save (API Format)" to generate a JSON file representing your workflow.
  
- Replace the contents of web/js/base_workflow.json with the generated JSON file to use your own completed workflow.
